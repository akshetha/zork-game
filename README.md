A delivery man, Axel, reaches a house surrounded by a prairie field away from the hustle of the city. He feels the breeze of the place and spots a mailbox that says welcome and has a letter that indicates that he should place the package inside the house and that the key to unlock is below the front mat. He rings first to get no reply and so he unlocks the door by himself to find himself stuck in a one story house.
